31A,2,-170,239,"I think it’s just number sequence, because at the moment I’m doing a lot of maths, and we’re just told to do everything in sequence and in order so I’ve just gone by number order, say 2 being the lowest and 9 being the highest, and it’s just gone in sequence from 2, 4, 7, 9 – it’s just going in size order. I think I did them on different levels to even them out as well – it’s easier to display as well, to be honest.",no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no

And I guess you noticed they’re in value order, so the 2 sort of naturally – well I thought I’d put it at the start ‘cause it’s the obvious one.

A linear scale, so you’ve got a midpoint and then more, most, so your arbitrary middle, more than that, most would be the furthest end, and then more, and the same with less and least. It was horizontal because it’s like a timeline, which is why the same would be true of the earlier-later timeline stuff. If there’d been - as well as more, most and stuff - something else I could have done a y as well, but I thought of it as something independent of what is to me quantity: more, most.

I haven’t really stuck to that properly but… So that’s why I’ve put 2 in the top middle, 4 around there and then 7 and 9.

And then I had a bit of deliberation because I was like ‘should I rank them?’ but it was just the sequence that the information was given to me in, and I didn’t think of it more as a graph as it was previously, because there weren’t any lines, so we had more freedom as to where we wanted to put them.

Mostly 4 and 9 are square numbers, and then 2 seems like a good starting point for most things, and then I put 7 up here because – this is my theory – instinctively, humans have an aversion to prime numbers, and although 2 is prime as well, I think 7 is odd and prime, so it kind of doesn’t fit as well with the other numbers, so I wanted to single it out a bit. 2, 4 and 9 share more characteristics.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
