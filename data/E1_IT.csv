I was aiming for that top right-hand corner anyway, but I’m not sure I wrote that one first or not.

It’s similar to a mathematical quadrant graph where you’ve got negative and negative on the bottom left, and then positive and positive on the top right, so it’s that as well - the fact that it’s worse and worse - really really bad, and that’s the worst it can possibly be.

You haven’t got almost the least - you’ve got the least, and then most you’ve got the most. I think it’s different from best and least - I think there’s varying degrees of best and worst… Maybe most and least is more material - if you’ve got the most apples, you’ve got the most physical apples in front of you, whereas best and worst is a subjective thing, so you could be the best at something in somebody’s eyes, but in someone else’s eyes you might not be, whereas if you’ve got the most pens you’re sat there with like fifty pens and the person next to you has two - they’ve got the least.

I think middle is neutral, bottom is negative and that’s why I put worst at the bottom, and future is higher up. I think it’s just because when you read and stuff that comes first and that’s the most important.

45,Male,Right,2,Diagonal,Diagonal,Diagonal,Diagonal1,Diagonal1,Diagonal2,"And then future and past, so I put past kind of around the middle because when I think of the deep timeline of the universe, past for us is quite recent, whereas I think that future is a lot bigger than our past as humans. And in my opinion, I’m more interested in what goes on in the future and more recent history than medieval and ancient history, so I kind of favoured future on this one.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,"So for least and most… For most I actually imagined a normal distribution, so a bell-shaped curve and put most where the mean and mode would be on that, because I guess that relates to lots of different things when you look at populations and lots of different things like heights and salaries and things like that. And then for least, I thought about it more in terms of quadrants, like least kind of belongs down here in the bottom left, but I wasn’t thinking of any specific examples when I was thinking about least.",no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,"So I put best furthest along the x axis because I guess it’s associated with excelling, so I guess you’ve got the highest value in one direction. And then the worst – I put it in the middle ground because being bad is common, worst is common.

48,Male,Right,2,Horizontal,Diagonal,Horizontal,Horizontal,Diagonal1,Horizontal,"With future and past I think time is kind of more linear and we don’t tend to go up and down with time.
