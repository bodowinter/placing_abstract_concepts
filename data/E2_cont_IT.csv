You could want more of something, but most is the ultimate. I guess it’s a hierarchical thing. Top of the pile – most. Bottom of the pile – least. ",no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,"I guess it’s the same principles [as time and quantity] really. Ah, I meant to put that the other way around. Why have I done that? It should have been the other way around. So I’m going to swap those. Why did I do that? Strange. So best would be first, and better second, and then worst at the bottom, and then worse there. And for the same reason – the best is at the top, and then worst is at the bottom. You can get better, but best is your best, and better’s on route to being best.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes
